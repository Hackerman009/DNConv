# DNConv
##### _A convolutional net to tell between day and night (images)_


- Works well with high accuracy for day but lousy accuracy for night images so could use better training data for night.
- Overall just a quick fun project to get familiarised with Keras, preprocessing data, building and training models.



#### Running scripts

to run just cd into directory of DNConv.py and run in terminal:

```sh
python DNConv.py 
```
or

To run in a jupyter notebook open DNConv.ipynb and run the cell below 'Run Model'
To do inference with the trained model, trained model weights can be loaded and run in the notebook but this needs some work to make more intuitive. Alternatively a script can be created and run instead of the notebook cells under 'Fitting Model'
